# SurvivalRPG
I've started this project as some core Java and OOP practice 
but then I've decided to go further because of the joy that come
from the possibility of creating a real, balanced and authentic game.    
There is no 'further' in it yet. I know it's not something playable and codes are kind of messy.
I will work on the documantation, more readable codes, user-interface, simple graphics, story,
items, locations and better user experience. 

The GOAL is playable game with meaningful story,
balanced items and simple but aesthetic graphics.
